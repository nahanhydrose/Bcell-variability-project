# B cell Variability Project

## Project Idea
This project studies how transcriptional variability in **B cells** changes with aging or disease using **single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)** data.  
Goal: To identify whether variability can act as a biomarker for immune aging.

## Steps
1. Find and download a dataset (GEO).
2. Analyze single-cell RNA-seq data using Python (Scanpy).
3. Measure gene expression variability across young vs old donors.
4. Identify highly variable genes and pathways.
5. Present results as plots and summary.

## Tools
- Python (Scanpy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GEO datasets
- GitHub for project management
