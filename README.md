# scRNA-seq Variability Analysis: GSE139324

## üî¨ Project Title
Can variations in single-cell RNA-seq be used as predictive biomarkers for disease progression?

## üìå Problem Statement
Studies suggest that variations in single-cell data can provide biological information rather than just noise.  
Zheng et al. (2023) showed that B cells from aged individuals vs. younger individuals display higher variability, pointing to transcriptional noise as a biomarker of aging.  
However, variability-based biomarkers remain underexplored for disease prediction and clinical decision-making.

## üéØ Objectives
- Quantify transcriptional variability in scRNA-seq datasets across different disease or condition states.
- Compare predictive power of variability-based features vs. mean-expression features.
- Identify enriched pathways with high transcriptional variability during cellular transitions.
- Develop a reproducible computational pipeline for variability-driven biomarker discovery.

## üìÇ Dataset
- **Source**: GEO accession [GSE139324](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139324)  
- **Type**: Human PBMC scRNA-seq (10x Genomics format)  

Raw files are **not stored in this repo** due to size.  
Download from GEO and place inside `data/raw/`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Preprocessing**: filtering, normalization, HVG selection.  
2. **Dimensionality reduction**: PCA + UMAP.  
3. **Clustering**: Leiden clustering.  
4. **Annotation**: Marker-based cluster annotation.  
5. **Validation**: Dotplot, heatmap, differential gene expression.
